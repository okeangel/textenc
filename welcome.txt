    Mass Text File Encoding Converter.

Now you can specify a directory. I will search for every '*.txt' file.
Next I will propose to you my suggestions for each file one by one.

Avaliable commands:
    "c" = CONVERT
        - so I will move original file to a backup directory
        (named <source_dir>_filenc_backup). Next I will create a new file
        with  a text encoded by standard.
    "n" = NOT convert
        - so I skip this one;
    "a" = convert ALL files with current confidence or above
        - so I backup and convert current file, and I will "silently" convert
        all next files with same encoding and same "confidence" or above.
        No prompts, no stops, no boring. Make sure there are no mistakes
        at this confidence value.
    "l" = not convert all files with current confidence or below, LEAVE it
        - so I skip current file and all files with same encoding and same
        confidence or below.

When all files surveyed, process will be finished.

You can restore original state of converted files. Just move the content of
<source_dir>_filenc_backup to <source_dir>.
